## Description ##

 ## A CLIENT-SERVER CHAT APPLICATION USING JAVA SOCKETS AND MULTITHREADING TO HANDLE MULTIPLE USERS 
 : This project is a simple yet functional multi-client chat application built using Java Sockets. It demonstrates a client-server model where multiple clients can connect to a central chat server and exchange real-time messages. The server handles multiple clients using multithreading and broadcasts each message to all connected clients.

# Project Overview
The Java Chat Application consists of two main components:

-Chat Server (ChatServer.java):
The server runs on a specific port (default is 12346) and continuously listens for incoming client connections. Each new client is handled in a separate thread, allowing concurrent messaging. The server receives a message from one client and broadcasts it to all other connected clients.

-Chat Client (ChatClient.java):
The client connects to the server using a socket. It provides two-way communication using separate threads: one for sending user input and one for receiving server responses. This ensures real-time chat flow and a responsive user interface.

# Features
üì§ Real-time message broadcasting

üßµ Multithreading for handling multiple clients

üîÑ Continuous listening and message relay

üñ•Ô∏è Console-based user interface

üîê Graceful handling of client disconnection

# Technologies Used

-Java SE (Standard Edition)

-Java Sockets (java.net)

-Multithreading (java.lang.Thread)

-I/O Streams (java.io)

 # Workflow
-Start the server: java ChatServer

-Open multiple terminals or command prompts.

-In each terminal, run: java ChatClient

-Enter messages from any client and see them broadcast to others.

# Use Cases
-Learning network programming basics in Java

-Understanding sockets and multi-threaded applications

-Creating basic real-time chat systems

# Conclusion
This project is a foundational implementation of a multi-client chat system in Java, showcasing how networking and multithreading can work together to build real-time applications. It serves as an excellent starting point for beginners looking to understand socket programming, thread management, and client-server architecture in Java.
Through this hands-on experience, I gained deeper insight into how real-world chat applications operate behind the scenes ‚Äî from establishing server connections and handling concurrent users, to broadcasting messages and maintaining seamless communication.

This project not only demonstrates core programming concepts but also strengthens problem-solving skills by dealing with real-time inputs, connection issues, and stream handling. It's simple yet powerful enough to evolve into a full-fledged messaging platform with additional features like GUI, authentication, encryption, and chat rooms.
